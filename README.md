Southern, But Love is a game that demonstrates the grammatical power of a comma. It is also a 2D infinite runner set in the deep southern bayous of the United States. The player must maneuver their airboat through the treacherous swamp in order to reach safety with their lover. But the trip will not be easy! Dense foliage, fierce alligators, and even their own kin stand between the lovers and their freedom.
